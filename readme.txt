Extend the Post Grid system in your Theme Blvd theme to a Portfolio Item custom post type.

== Description ==

@TODO

== Installation ==

1. Upload `portfolios` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work if I'm not using a Theme Blvd theme? =

Yup, but it just won't do a whole lot. You'll essentially end up with a "Portfolio Item" custom post type and associated "Portfolio" taxonomy with a cool retina icon.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =

* This is the first release.
